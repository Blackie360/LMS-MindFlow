# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the Next.js routing conflict where both `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` and `app/dashboard/page.tsx` resolve to the same `/dashboard` path. The application uses a route group `(dashboard)` for authenticated pages with a shared layout, but has created a redundant routing structure that causes compilation errors.

## Architecture

### Current Problematic Structure
```
app/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Authenticated layout with sidebar
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   └── page.tsx        # Resolves to /dashboard
│   ├── courses/
│   ├── admin/
│   └── my-courses/
└── dashboard/
    └── page.tsx            # Also resolves to /dashboard ❌
```

### Proposed Solution Structure
```
app/
├── (dashboard)/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Authenticated layout with sidebar
│   ├── page.tsx            # Resolves to / (root dashboard)
│   ├── courses/
│   ├── admin/
│   └── my-courses/
└── dashboard -> redirect   # Optional: redirect to root for backward compatibility
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Route Group Layout (`app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Provides authenticated layout with sidebar for all dashboard pages
- **Current State**: Working correctly with authentication and layout
- **Action**: No changes needed

### 2. Dashboard Page Content
- **Current Issue**: Two separate implementations with similar functionality
- **Solution**: Consolidate into single implementation at route group root
- **Location**: `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`

### 3. Content Consolidation Strategy
- **Primary Source**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (cleaner implementation)
- **Secondary Source**: `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` (more detailed stats)
- **Approach**: Merge best features from both implementations

## Data Models

### Dashboard Content Structure
```typescript
interface DashboardData {
  user: {
    id: string
    name: string
    email: string
    role: 'STUDENT' | 'INSTRUCTOR'
  }
  stats: {
    totalCourses: number
    totalStudents?: number  // Instructor only
    totalEnrollments: number
  }
  recentEnrollments?: Enrollment[]  // Student only
}
```

### Component Props
```typescript
interface DashboardPageProps {
  // Server component - no props needed
}
```

## Error Handling

### Routing Error Prevention
- Remove duplicate page files to eliminate path conflicts
- Ensure single source of truth for dashboard route
- Implement proper error boundaries for dashboard content

### Authentication Error Handling
- Maintain existing redirect to `/auth` for unauthenticated users
- Handle database connection errors gracefully
- Provide fallback content when stats cannot be loaded

### Database Error Handling
- Wrap database queries in try-catch blocks
- Provide default values when queries fail
- Log errors for debugging while showing user-friendly messages

## Testing Strategy

### Route Resolution Testing
1. **Compilation Test**
   - Verify application compiles without routing conflicts
   - Ensure no duplicate route warnings

2. **Navigation Testing**
   - Test direct navigation to `/dashboard`
   - Verify authenticated users reach dashboard content
   - Confirm unauthenticated users redirect to auth

3. **Content Loading Testing**
   - Test dashboard loads for both STUDENT and INSTRUCTOR roles
   - Verify stats display correctly
   - Test error states when database queries fail

### Backward Compatibility Testing
- Test existing bookmarks and direct links
- Verify navigation from other parts of the application
- Ensure no broken internal links

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Consolidation
1. Analyze both dashboard implementations
2. Create unified dashboard component with best features
3. Place consolidated component at `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`

### Phase 2: Cleanup
1. Remove `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
2. Remove `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/` directory
3. Update any internal links if necessary

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Test compilation and route resolution
2. Verify dashboard functionality for both user roles
3. Test authentication flow and redirects

## Route Group Strategy

### Purpose of (dashboard) Route Group
- **Organization**: Groups all authenticated pages under shared layout
- **Layout Sharing**: Provides sidebar and authentication wrapper
- **URL Structure**: Does not affect URL paths (parentheses are ignored)

### Correct Usage Pattern
```
app/(dashboard)/
├── layout.tsx     # Shared authenticated layout
├── page.tsx       # Root dashboard at /
├── courses/       # /courses
├── admin/         # /admin
└── my-courses/    # /my-courses
```

### Benefits of This Structure
- Single dashboard entry point
- Consistent layout across all authenticated pages
- Clear separation between public and authenticated routes
- Follows Next.js route group best practices

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Flow
- Maintain existing authentication checks in layout
- Ensure dashboard content only accessible to authenticated users
- Preserve role-based content display logic

### Data Access
- Keep existing database query patterns
- Maintain proper error handling for failed queries
- Ensure user data isolation (students see only their data)

## Performance Considerations

### Server-Side Rendering
- Maintain async server component pattern
- Keep database queries optimized
- Use Promise.all for parallel data fetching where appropriate

### Error Recovery
- Implement graceful degradation when stats cannot be loaded
- Provide loading states during data fetching
- Cache frequently accessed data where appropriate

## Migration Considerations

### Existing User Impact
- URLs remain the same (`/dashboard`)
- Functionality preserved
- No user-facing changes expected

### Developer Impact
- Cleaner file structure
- Single source of truth for dashboard
- Easier maintenance and updates

### Deployment Strategy
- Can be deployed as single atomic change
- No database migrations required
- No environment variable changes needed
