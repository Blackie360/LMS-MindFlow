# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Next.js routing conflict where two pages resolve to the same `/dashboard` path, causing compilation errors. The application currently has both `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` and `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, which creates a conflict. We need to restructure the routing to eliminate this conflict while maintaining proper dashboard functionality and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to resolve the routing conflict between duplicate dashboard pages, so that the application compiles and runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application compiles THEN the system SHALL NOT have multiple pages resolving to the same path
2. WHEN accessing `/dashboard` THEN the system SHALL serve exactly one dashboard page
3. WHEN the routing structure is updated THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN users navigate to dashboard routes THEN they SHALL reach the intended dashboard content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access my dashboard seamlessly, so that I can view my courses and account information without routing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/dashboard` THEN the system SHALL display the main dashboard page
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the dashboard SHALL load without 500 errors
3. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN all dashboard components SHALL render correctly
4. WHEN navigation occurs within dashboard sections THEN routes SHALL resolve properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear and logical routing structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows Next.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the file structure THEN the routing hierarchy SHALL be clear and logical
2. WHEN using route groups THEN they SHALL serve their intended purpose of organization
3. WHEN adding new dashboard routes THEN the structure SHALL accommodate them without conflicts
4. WHEN following Next.js conventions THEN the routing SHALL align with framework best practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation and URLs, so that bookmarks and direct links continue to work after the routing fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users have bookmarked dashboard URLs THEN existing bookmarks SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the routing structure changes THEN user-facing URLs SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN redirects are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented transparently
4. WHEN users refresh dashboard pages THEN the content SHALL load correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for dashboard routes, so that users receive appropriate feedback when navigation issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard routes fail to load THEN users SHALL see appropriate error messages
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN users SHALL be redirected to the auth page
3. WHEN route resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error information
4. WHEN debugging routing issues THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
