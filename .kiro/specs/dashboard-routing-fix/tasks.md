# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Analyze and consolidate dashboard page implementations


  - Compare the two existing dashboard page implementations
  - Identify the best features and functionality from each version
  - Create a unified dashboard component that combines the strengths of both
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Create consolidated dashboard page at route group root
  - Create new `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` file with consolidated dashboard content
  - Implement role-based dashboard display (STUDENT vs INSTRUCTOR views)
  - Include proper error handling and database query optimization
  - Ensure authentication checks and redirects work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.1_

- [ ] 3. Remove duplicate dashboard files to resolve routing conflict
  - Delete `app/dashboard/page.tsx` file
  - Remove `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/` directory and its contents
  - Verify no other files reference the removed dashboard directory
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Update any internal navigation links if necessary
  - Search codebase for any hardcoded links to `/dashboard` routes
  - Update navigation components if they reference the old structure
  - Ensure all internal routing continues to work correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Test compilation and route resolution
  - Verify the application compiles without routing conflicts
  - Test that `/dashboard` route resolves to the correct page
  - Confirm no duplicate route warnings or errors appear
  - Test both development and production build processes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Verify dashboard functionality for all user roles
  - Test dashboard loading for STUDENT role users
  - Test dashboard loading for INSTRUCTOR role users
  - Verify stats and data display correctly for each role
  - Test error handling when database queries fail
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Test authentication flow and protected route access
  - Verify unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth`
  - Test that authenticated users can access dashboard without errors
  - Confirm session persistence works across page refreshes
  - Test navigation between dashboard and other authenticated pages
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2_
