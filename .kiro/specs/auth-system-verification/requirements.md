# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that the existing Better Auth authentication system in the MindFlow LMS application is fully functional and properly configured. The system currently has email/password authentication with user roles (STUDENT/INSTRUCTOR), but needs verification and potential fixes to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password, so that I can access the learning platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the auth page THEN the system SHALL display a sign-up form with name, email, and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account in the database
3. WHEN a user submits invalid data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. WHEN account creation is successful THEN the system SHALL create a valid session for the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my account and courses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the auth page THEN the system SHALL display a sign-in form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user successfully
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a valid session
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to persist across page refreshes, so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across page refreshes
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser THEN the system SHALL maintain their session if not expired
3. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the auth page
4. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to the auth page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to sign out of my account, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the sign-out button THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session
2. WHEN sign-out is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the auth page
3. WHEN a user tries to access protected routes after sign-out THEN the system SHALL redirect to the auth page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user data to be properly stored and managed, so that the authentication system is reliable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL store user data in the correct database tables
2. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL create session records in the database
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN the system starts THEN all required database tables SHALL exist and be properly configured

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that authentication issues can be diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users
