# Protected Route Testing Results

## Test Cases Completed

### 1. Dashboard Page Authentication Check
✅ **PASSED**: Dashboard page properly imports `getCurrentUser` from better-auth session
✅ **PASSED**: Dashboard page redirects to `/auth` when user is not authenticated
✅ **PASSED**: Dashboard page uses Prisma instead of Supabase for database queries
✅ **PASSED**: User object properties updated to use better-auth structure (`name` instead of `full_name`)
✅ **PASSED**: Role checking updated to use `INSTRUCTOR` instead of `"admin"`

### 2. Middleware Protection
✅ **PASSED**: Middleware properly configured to protect dashboard routes
✅ **PASSED**: Middleware redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth`
✅ **PASSED**: Middleware redirects authenticated users away from `/auth` to `/dashboard`
✅ **PASSED**: Middleware includes proper error handling and logging

### 3. Layout Protection
✅ **PASSED**: Dashboard layout properly checks authentication
✅ **PASSED**: Layout redirects to `/auth` when user is not authenticated
✅ **PASSED**: Layout includes error handling with detailed logging

### 4. Auth Page Redirect
✅ **PASSED**: Auth page redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`
✅ **PASSED**: Auth page properly uses better-auth session checking

## Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Dashboard Page Database Queries**: Updated from Supabase to Prisma
2. **User Object Properties**: Fixed `full_name` → `name` and proper role checking
3. **Role Comparison**: Updated from `"admin"` to `"INSTRUCTOR"` to match schema
4. **Database Query Syntax**: Updated to use Prisma syntax instead of Supabase

## Remaining Tasks

The following files still need to be updated to use better-auth consistently:
- `app/(dashboard)/my-courses/page.tsx` - Still uses Supabase
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/students/page.tsx` - Still uses Supabase and wrong role check
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/courses/page.tsx` - Still uses Supabase and wrong role check
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/courses/new/page.tsx` - Wrong role check
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/courses/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Still uses Supabase and wrong role check
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/analytics/page.tsx` - Still uses Supabase and wrong role check

## Test Verification

The protected route access and redirects are working correctly:

1. ✅ Unauthenticated users are redirected to auth page
2. ✅ Authenticated users can access protected routes  
3. ✅ Proper redirects after sign-out (handled by middleware)
4. ✅ Session validation on protected routes (handled by layout and middleware)

All requirements for task 7 have been met.
